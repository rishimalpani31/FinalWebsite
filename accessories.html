         <li> #1 Yoga Mat </li>

            <p>Regardless of whether you’re using your own or yoga studio equipment, you need a yoga mat in order to practice yoga.</p>

       
            <li> # 2 Yoga Towels </li>

                <p> <strong>why do I need a <em>yoga</em> towel?</strong></p>
                <p> It absorbs your sweat and increases in grip so you don't slide on your mat, risking injury. Yoga towels can also prevent your mat from moving because it prevents sweat from seeping within.</p>
          
          
            <li> #3 Water Bottle</li>

<p>It’s so important to stay hydrated when exercising, and often many newbie yogis forget the fact that yoga is an intense workout. You wouldn’t practice without a mat, and you should take that same kind of energy when it comes to bringing a water bottle. </p>
<p>Treat your water bottle as a piece of equipment that is needed for yoga, not an optional accessory, similar to the need for running water bottles during running!<p>
            <p>The more water we lose from sweating, the more water we have to replace through drinking. If the average person weighs 150 pounds, then that means their body consists of 5 litres of water.</p>

<li> #4 Yoga Wheel </li>
<img src="https://origympersonaltrainercourses.co.uk/files/img_cache/12918/1920_1618492895_yogaheadstandequipment.jpeg?1618493236" width="500">
<p>The yoga wheel is a hollow, circular-shaped prop  that is designed to aid in stretching, releasing tension and improving your flexibility.
 <p>  Additionally, the yoga wheel is a great piece of equipment for yoga as you’ll be able to stretch back and forth, whilst also allowing yourself to get into deeper positions.</p>
<br>
 <p>The yoga wheel is also a good piece of equipment used in yoga wind-down sessions and is great for relaxing tense muscles. If you’re having trouble sleeping after a nightly exercise, we would recommend switching to yoga wheel assisted practices for a night of better sleep. <p>
